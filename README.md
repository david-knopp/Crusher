# Crusher
> A simple component-based C++ game engine

## Summary
Crusher is a small game engine / graphics library created during the summer of 2014 before my senior year of DigiPen. It was made mostly for learning purposes, and to use as a base for projects in my senior graphics classes (where several others used it as well!).

It is not meant for production, and is not being maintained.
